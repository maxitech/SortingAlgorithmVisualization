# Sorting Algorithm Visualization
This project is a sorting algorithm visualization tool built with React. It provides a visual representation of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort. Users can interact with the visualization, adjust the array size, and observe the sorting process step by step.

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript
- CSS

## Build Tools
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A fast and efficient build tool for modern web development. Vite is used to bundle and serve assets during development and optimize them for production.

## Features
- **Dynamic Array Generation:** Allows users to dynamically generate arrays of varying lengths for sorting visualization.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Supports visualization for various sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- **Interactive Interface:** Provides an interactive user interface for selecting sorting algorithms, adjusting array size, and observing sorting animations.
- **Real-time Visualization:** Renders sorting animations in real-time, allowing users to observe each step of the sorting process.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal viewing experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## What I Learned
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Deepened my understanding of sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Insertion Sort. Explored their implementations, complexities, and optimizations.
- **Big O Notation:** Gained insights into algorithm analysis, particularly focusing on Big O notation for evaluating algorithm efficiency and performance. However, I recognize that this is just scratching the surface of a vast field.

## Sources and Inspiration
- The idea for this project was inspired by similar sorting algorithm visualization [project](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Sorting-Visualizer).
- My understanding of sorting algorithms was enhanced by watching various YouTube videos and reading articles on Wikipedia. Some useful resources include:
  - [Sorting Algorithms Explained Visually](https://youtu.be/RfXt_qHDEPw?si=8jCAgmIaRcfpTnSs)
  - [Merge Sort - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort)
